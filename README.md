# s-net
A C++ networking library for IPv4/IPv6 and TCP/UDP

## Description ##
s-net was written a while ago to have a simple and thin layer between OS-specific networking interfaces and C++ applications. A lot of libraries out the were simply too bloated or didn't support IPv6, so I decided to roll my own.
The code was developed on Windows and Linux using gcc and MinGW. Support for other platforms and compilers shouldn't be too hard to add, though.
